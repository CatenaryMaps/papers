  abstract  = {The paper presents two algorithms for the computation of intersection of geodesics and minimum distance from a point to a geodesic on the ellipsoid, respectively. They are based on the iterative use of direct and inverse problems of geodesy by means of their implementations with machine-precision accuracy in GeographicLib. The algorithms yield the same results as those obtained by Karney’s approach based on the use of auxiliary ellipsoidal gnomonic projections, with the advantage on our side that the algorithms are not limited to distances below 10000 km. This results in our algorithm being the only general solution for the problem of minimum distance from a point to a geodesic on the ellipsoid.},
